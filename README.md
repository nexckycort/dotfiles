# Oni Setup: A personal, opinionated setup for Ubuntu â€” just how I like it.

**Oni Setup** is my personal and opinionated configuration for Ubuntu 24.04+,
designed to automate the installation and setup of essential terminal and
desktop tools, as well as the application of custom dotfiles.

This setup is based on the excellent work of Basecamp's
[Omakub project](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub).
