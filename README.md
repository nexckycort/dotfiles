# Oni Setup: A personal, opinionated setup for Ubuntu â€” just how I like it.

**Oni Setup** is my personal and opinionated configuration for Ubuntu 24.04+,
designed to automate the installation and setup of essential terminal and
desktop tools, as well as the application of custom dotfiles.

including:

- Installation of terminal tools like Docker, mise, pnpm, zsh with oh-my-zsh,
  fastfetch, lazydocker, etc.

- Adjustments for GNOME environments to improve the desktop experience.
- Organized scripts for modularity and easy maintenance.
